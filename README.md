## Important

For the client's information, I made up something. 

I didn't understand what is the functionality of the "overview" button ... because when the user navigates to the "work ticket" screen the user would find at the bottom of the screen the buttons. (“overview”,“work details”, “purchasing”, “finishing up”, picture logo). If the only button that should work is "overview", it is not clear to me what the functionality of this button is if it should take the user to a page that the user is already on.
